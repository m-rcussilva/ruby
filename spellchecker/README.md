# SpellChecker CLI Command

This is a simple CLI command written in Ruby that checks if the name of a programming language
is spelled correctly. The SpellChecker uses a dictionary of programming language names to check for
correct spellings.

### Installation

To use the SpellChecker, you need to have Ruby installed on your system. You can check
if you have Ruby installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```
ruby -v
```

If you don't have Ruby installed, you can download it from the official website:
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/.

Once you have Ruby installed, download or clone the SpellChecker repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where the repository is located in your terminal.

### Usage

To use the SpellChecker, run the following command in your terminal:

```
ruby spellchecker.rb
```

The SpellChecker will prompt you to enter the name of a programming language.
Type the name of the programming language and press Enter.

The SpellChecker will then check if the programming language name is spelled correctly.
If the name is spelled correctly, the SpellChecker will display a success message.
If the name is misspelled, the SpellChecker will display an error message.

### Customization

You can add your own list of programming language names to the dictionary.txt file.
Each name should be on a separate line and in lowercase.
